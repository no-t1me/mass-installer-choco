This is configured for my personal use only but feel free to copy commands if u want to set it up for urself.
Unfortunatly some packages like steam and stremio just fail to install on my side so i had to paste links to websites to sorta automatize the process.
I highly recommend trying chocolatey when it works it feels amazing to have everything download and install without clicking through sites.

!Remember to put -y as a parameter at the end of each command otherwise u will have to agree to every single install!
